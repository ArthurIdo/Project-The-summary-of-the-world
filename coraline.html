    <h1>Coraline book summary</h1>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h3>"Coraline" is a fantasy novel by Neil Gaiman that follows the story of a young girl named Coraline Jones.

      Coraline moves into a new apartment with her parents in an old house.
      She discovers a hidden door that leads to an alternate world that appears to be a mirror image of her own reality.
      In this parallel world, Coraline encounters an "Other" mother and father who have buttons for eyes.
      The Other world seems perfect at first, but Coraline soon realizes that it's actually a trap.
      The Other mother wants to keep Coraline in the alternate world forever and replace her eyes with buttons.
      Coraline meets other trapped souls, including ghost children and talking animals, who warn her about the Other
      mother's true intentions.
      She must use her wits and bravery to outsmart the Other mother and save herself and the souls trapped in the Other
      world.
      Coraline learns that the Other mother is a powerful and manipulative entity with a hidden agenda.
      She discovers that the Other mother has kidnapped children from different realities in the past.
      Coraline confronts various challenges and obstacles, including a cat who can traverse between worlds and an Other
      version of herself.
      She must navigate through surreal and dangerous landscapes, facing her fears and unraveling the mystery of the
      Other world.
      Coraline realizes the importance of family and the value of her own world as she fights to escape the Other
      mother's clutches.
      With the help of her wits, courage, and newfound allies, Coraline manages to outwit the Other mother and close the
      door to the Other world.
      She returns to her own reality and reunites with her real parents, grateful for the ordinary but precious life she
      has.
      The novel ends on a hopeful note, with Coraline appreciating the beauty of her own world and the lessons she has
      learned from her extraordinary adventure.</h3>
