    <h3>"Your Name" is a novel written by Makoto Shinkai, published in 2016. It tells the story of two high school
      students, Taki and Mitsuha, who inexplicably swap bodies and lives sporadically. Taki lives in Tokyo, while
      Mitsuha resides in a rural town called Itomori.
      The story follows their struggles to understand and cope with this bizarre phenomenon, as they leave messages for
      each other to communicate and try to unravel the mystery behind their body-swapping experiences. Along the way,
      they develop a deep bond and affection for each other.
      As Taki and Mitsuha search for answers, they discover that their lives are connected by a tragic event that
      occurred years ago. They embark on a quest to change the past and prevent disaster from striking again, while
      facing obstacles and confronting their feelings for each other.
      Time becomes a central theme as Taki and Mitsuha navigate through parallel realities, trying to find a way to
      reunite in person. They encounter heart-wrenching moments and make sacrifices to save each other and rewrite their
      fate.
      The novel beautifully portrays themes of love, fate, and the significance of connections across time and space. It
      explores the complexities of human relationships, the power of memories, and the resilience of the human spirit.
      In a race against time, Taki and Mitsuha must come to terms with their own identities and make choices that will
      impact their lives forever. The story culminates in a breathtaking and emotional climax that will leave readers
      captivated and moved.
      "Your Name" is a tale of romance, mystery, and the power of destiny that has captivated readers around the world
