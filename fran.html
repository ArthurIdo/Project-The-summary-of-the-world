        <h3>"Frankenstein" is a novel written by Mary Shelley and published in 1818. It tells the story of Victor
            Frankenstein, a young scientist who creates a monstrous creature in his laboratory.
            Victor Frankenstein becomes obsessed with the idea of creating life and succeeds in animating a creature
            made from body parts. But when he sees the monstrous result of his experiment, he is horrified and flees
            from his creation.
            The creature, rejected and abandoned by its creator, roams the world, seeking understanding and acceptance.
            However, it is met with fear and rejection from society, leading it to seek revenge against its creator.
            The creature's actions result in a series of tragic events, including the deaths of Victor's loved ones.
            Victor, plagued by guilt and remorse, becomes determined to destroy the creature.
            The novel follows Victor's pursuit of the creature across Europe, as he grapples with the consequences of
            his actions and the moral implications of playing God. The creature, in turn, confronts Victor and shares
            its own perspective on its miserable existence.
            The story delves into themes of ambition, science, morality, isolation, and the consequences of unchecked
            ambition. It also explores the nature of humanity, as both Victor and the creature struggle with their own
            sense of identity and purpose.
            As the novel reaches its climax, Victor's health deteriorates, and he becomes consumed by his desire for
            revenge against the creature. The story ends with a tragic and final confrontation between Victor and his
            creation in the Arctic wilderness.
            "Frankenstein" is a seminal work of gothic horror and science fiction that explores the ethical and moral
            implications of scientific progress and the consequences of playing with the forces of nature. It remains a
            timeless and thought-provoking novel that continues to captivate readers with its cautionary tale of
            ambition and hubris.
